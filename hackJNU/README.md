# Early Forest Fire Prediction and Detection System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust Early Forest Fire Prediction and Detection System using a combination of Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning, and OpenCV. The system is designed to detect and predict forest fires in their early stages, allowing for timely intervention and mitigation.

## Features

- **IoT Integration:** Utilizes sensors deployed in forested areas to collect real-time data on temperature, humidity, and smoke levels.
  
- **Machine Learning:** Implements a machine learning model trained on historical data to predict the likelihood of a fire outbreak based on the sensor inputs.

- **OpenCV Integration:** Employs computer vision techniques using OpenCV for real-time image and video analysis to detect smoke and flames.

- **Alert System:** Sends immediate alerts and notifications to relevant authorities and stakeholders when a potential fire is detected.

- **Web Dashboard:** Provides a user-friendly web-based interface for monitoring and managing the system, displaying real-time data, and generating reports.

## Requirements

- **Hardware:**
  - IoT devices (sensors) for temperature, humidity, and smoke detection.
  - Cameras for visual surveillance.
  
- **Software:**
  - Python 3.x
  - OpenCV library
  - Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
  - Web framework (e.g., Flask, Django) for the dashboard
  - MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) for IoT communication
  
- **Communication:**
  - Establish a secure communication protocol for IoT devices to transmit data to the central system.
  - Utilize MQTT for efficient and reliable message exchange between devices and the central server.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies.

Configure IoT devices with appropriate credentials and communication settings.

Train the machine learning model using historical data.

Deploy IoT devices in forested areas and ensure they are connected to the central system.

The system will continuously monitor sensor data and predict the likelihood of a fire outbreak using the trained machine learning model.

In case of a potential fire, the system will trigger alerts and notifications to relevant authorities.

Use the web dashboard to monitor real-time data, view alerts, and generate reports for further analysis.

Feel free to contribute and improve the system to enhance early forest fire detection and prediction capabilities.

Note: Ensure compliance with local regulations and ethical considerations while deploying and using this system in real-world scenarios.

Feel free to modify and adapt this according to your specific needs!
